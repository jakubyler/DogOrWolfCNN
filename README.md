# GameLengthPrediction

In this project we classify photos of wolves and dogs using CNNs.

Libraries:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow, itertools, os, random, shutil

Steps:
1. To run the code download the database and put it into folder with Dog_or_Wolf_CNN.ipynb 
Data available at: https://www.kaggle.com/harishvutukuri/dogs-vs-wolves

2. Open your Terminal (MacOS, Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows OS). If you are running Anaconda, open your Anaconda Prompt and find path to Dog_or_Wolf_CNN.ipynb - this file contains code with necessery comments that describe the "journey" through the project.

3. Run all cells.
